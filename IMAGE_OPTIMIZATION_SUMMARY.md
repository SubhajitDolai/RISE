# Image Loading Optimization Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Hero Section Images Not Loading with Priority**: The hero section was using CSS `background-image` instead of Next.js `Image` component
2. **No Priority Loading**: Critical above-the-fold images weren't being loaded with priority
3. **Suboptimal Image Loading**: Regular `Image` component usage without optimization configurations

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. HeroSection.tsx

- ✅ Replaced CSS `background-image` with `OptimizedImage` component
- ✅ Added priority loading for the first hero slide
- ✅ Implemented proper responsive sizing with `fill` and `sizes`
- ✅ Added blur placeholder for better UX
- ✅ Quality set to 90 for hero images (high quality)

### 2. ProjectsSection.tsx

- ✅ Replaced `Image` with `OptimizedImage` component
- ✅ Priority loading for first 3 projects (above the fold)
- ✅ Responsive sizing: `(max-width: 768px) 100vw, (max-width: 1024px) 50vw, 33vw`
- ✅ Quality set to 85 for good balance
- ✅ Blur placeholder for loading states

### 3. ServicesSection.tsx

- ✅ Replaced `Image` with `OptimizedImage` component
- ✅ Priority loading for first 4 services (typically visible on load)
- ✅ Responsive sizing: `(max-width: 768px) 100vw, (max-width: 1024px) 50vw, 25vw`
- ✅ Quality set to 80 for performance
- ✅ Blur placeholder for loading states

### 4. AboutSection.tsx

- ✅ Replaced `Image` with `OptimizedImage` component
- ✅ Priority loading for company logo
- ✅ Quality set to 90 for logo clarity
- ✅ Blur placeholder for loading states

### 5. OptimizedImage.tsx Component Enhancements

- ✅ Improved loading state handling
- ✅ Better CSS class management
- ✅ Smoother transitions (500ms duration)
- ✅ No loading indicator for priority images (immediate display)
- ✅ Enhanced gradient loading placeholder

### 6. Image Preloader (New Feature)

- ✅ Created `/app/lib/imagePreloader.ts`
- ✅ Preloads critical images on page load
- ✅ Uses high-priority `fetchPriority` for critical images
- ✅ Integrated into main page component

### 7. CSS Optimizations

- ✅ Added custom scale classes for better performance
- ✅ Hardware acceleration for transform properties
- ✅ Optimized image scaling effects

### 8. Next.js Configuration Updates

- ✅ Extended cache TTL to 30 days for production
- ✅ Added more device sizes for better responsive images
- ✅ Added `remotePatterns` for external images
- ✅ Enhanced image size configurations

## Priority Loading Strategy

### Critical Images (Priority: true)

1. **Hero Section**: First slide only (`/Complex-1 Construction.webp`)
2. **About Section**: Company logo (`/rise-logo.webp`)
3. **Projects Section**: First 3 project images
4. **Services Section**: First 4 service images

### Non-Critical Images (Priority: false)

- Hero slides 2-3 (loaded after first slide)
- Projects beyond the first 3
- Services beyond the first 4

## Performance Benefits

1. **Faster Initial Page Load**: Critical images load with priority
2. **Better Core Web Vitals**: Reduced LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)
3. **Smoother User Experience**: Blur placeholders prevent layout shift
4. **Optimized Bandwidth**: Responsive images serve appropriate sizes
5. **Better Caching**: Extended cache periods for faster repeat visits
6. **Progressive Loading**: Non-critical images load after critical content

## Testing Verified

- ✅ Build successful without errors
- ✅ All components render correctly
- ✅ No TypeScript/linting errors
- ✅ Production server starts successfully
- ✅ Images load with proper optimization

## Image Loading Flow

1. **Page Load**: Critical images preloaded via `<link rel="preload">`
2. **Hero Section**: First slide loads with priority
3. **Above Fold**: Company logo and first few projects/services load with priority
4. **Below Fold**: Remaining images load progressively as user scrolls
5. **Caching**: All images cached for 30 days for repeat visits
